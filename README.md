# HEART DISEASE ANALYSIS

This project aims to analyze heart disease data and build a predictive model to identify potential risk factors and predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.


# Project Description

The main goal of this project is to predict heart disease based on various features such as gendern age, CigsPerDay, diabetes, Blood Pressure etc. The project aims to analyze a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), develop machine learning models and evaluate their performance to provide accurate predictions.
# Data Collection

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and presence of heart disease. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/neisha/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression).
## Deployment

The web app has been build using streamlit.
